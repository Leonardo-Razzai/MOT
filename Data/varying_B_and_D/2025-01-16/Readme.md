Measurement parameters
- Master locked at 3'-4' crossover
- Magentic field B is scanned from 3 to 11 A
- BN_L (loading beat-note cooler) is scanned
  -  from 1030 to 1044 MHz with step 2 MHz for B = 3 - 9 A
  -  from 1034 to 1048 with step 2 MHz for B = 10 - 11 A
- After 4 sec of mot loading -> Cooler is set to resonance (BN = 1027 MHz)
- Pressure is constant during the measurements.
